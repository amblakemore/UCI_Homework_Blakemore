# Kickstart My Chart

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

1.    Three conclusions that we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns is that it appears that kick starters in the category of film music and theater tend to be the most successful category. The data also shows that there is more success than failure with these campaigns, and the greater the goal of your campaign, the more likely it is that your campaign will either fail or be canceled.
2.    Some limitations of the data set are that there was not an equal number of campaigns by category. Itâ€™s harder to draw conclusions on some categories when there are only a small number of campaigns in that category. Additionally, we do not know what the various marketing or add campaigns for each project were. 
3.    One possible graph we could have used would be a scatter plot to see if there were any trends between categories. We also could further examine the relationships between the goals of the campaigns and the result of the campaign since there seems to be a trend where the larger the goal got, the more likely it was to fail.
