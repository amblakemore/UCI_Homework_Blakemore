# The Truth Is Out There

Aliens-R-Real have collected all of the eye-witness reports of extra-terrestrials that have come to Earth and needs help organizing all of their data. We are tasked with building a table that will allow the users to filer the data for specific values.

Using a basic HTML webpage, we can begin by incorporating the provided data of the reported alien encounters. Using d3 we can append the tables to our webpage and add the corresponding rows: date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

We will filter the data on the date/time column to pull up all of the sightings from that specific date.
