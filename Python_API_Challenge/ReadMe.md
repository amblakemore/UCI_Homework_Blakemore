# Python API Challenge


Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

### WeatherPy
We've created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. We've accomplished this by using the Citipy library and the OpenWeatherMap API. After we've created a DataFrame to analyze our data, we've created a series of scatter plots to showcase the relationships between:
