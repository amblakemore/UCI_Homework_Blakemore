# Heroes of Pymoli

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.


### Analysis
- One of the first conclusions that we can make looking at this data is that the demographic of this game is heavily male with just over 84% of the game’s population reporting as male
- When we look at the game’s demographics broken down by age, the biggest portion of the game’s population is in the 20-24-year-old age range (44.79%) with the 15-19-year-old (18.58%) and 25-19-year-old groups (13.37%) as the other largest portion of the game’s population.
- However, when we look at the purchasing analysis, the group with the most purchases by a large margin is the 20-24-year-old age range (365 purchases), which fits with having the most represented players in the game. However, it is the 35-39-year-old group that has the highest average purchase price and highest average total purchase per person. This would make sense as this age group would probably have more disposable income to spend on a video game
