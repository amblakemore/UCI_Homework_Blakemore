# Heroes of Pymoli



### Analysis
- One of the first conclusions that we can make looking at this data is that the demographic of this game is heavily male with just over 84% of the game’s population reporting as male
- When we look at the game’s demographics broken down by age, the biggest portion of the game’s population is in the 20-24-year-old age range with the 15-19-year-old and 25-19-year-old groups as the other largest portion of the game’s population.
- However, when we look at the purchasing analysis, the group with the most purchases by a large margin is the 20-24-year-old age range, which fits with having the most represented players in the game. However, it is the 35-39-year-old group that has the highest average purchase price and highest average total purchase per person. This would make sense as this age group would probably have more disposable income to spend on a video game
